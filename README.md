# Python Programming Language Course

This repository contains the code exercises from the first programming language course I took. The exercises are based on the course "Algoritmos e Lógica de Programação - O Curso COMPLETO". I completed all the exercises without watching the solution videos.

## Overview

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each representing a different exercise or topic covered in the course. Each directory contains Python scripts that solve specific problems or demonstrate particular programming concepts.
